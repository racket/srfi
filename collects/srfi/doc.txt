PLT Scheme support for _SRFIs_ (`surfies')
==========================================

This is an implementation of (some) SRFIs to the PLT Scheme system. 
It is intended for PLT Scheme v200+.

If you need more information on SRFI, please visit:

		       http://srfi.schemers.org/

Loading
-------

To load a particular SRFI, use the following form:

		    (require (lib "N.ss" "srfi"))

if you know the number of the SRFI you want to load.  This is the
prefered method, or this one:

		 (require (lib "NAME.ss" "srfi" "N"))

if you know the `informative name' of the SRFI.

N, is a number corresponding to the sub-collection that holds a
particular SRFI, and NAME is a more descriptive name we assigned to
the main file in which the SRFI is defined.  For instance, to load
SRFI-13 you have to do either one of:

		    (require (lib "13.ss" "srfi"))

or,

	       (require (lib "string.ss" "srfi" "13"))

** SPECIAL NOTE ON SRFI 1 **

Since srfi-1 includes names that collide with mzscheme primitives,
it is available in two forms. The wrapper, (lib "1.ss" "srfi"),
provides names like "map" and "reverse!", and therefore cannot
be required in a module written in the 'mzscheme' language.
The implementation, (lib "list.ss" "srfi" "1"), supplies the
colliding names with a prefix of 's:' (e.g. "s:map", "s:reverse!")
and is therefore suitable for requires in a module. Use the first
if you're writing a top-level program that wants cross-platform
portability, use the second if you're writing a module.

** END OF SPECIAL NOTE **

Here is a table that has an SRFI, file name, and the sub-collection
number of the already ported SRFIs:

| structure with the PLT Scheme one, they are not the same, and all
| procedures from this library expect the former.

That's it for now.  If you have ported other SRFIs, and want them
added to this library, please let us know:

 + the main PLT Scheme discussion list:

   PLT Scheme <plt-scheme@fast.cs.utah.edu>

 + the Schematics-people @ sourceforge.net.  We are NOT members of the
PLT group, the Schematics project is devoted to create code for PLT
Scheme ONLY, though.  This SRFI port effort will try to be developed,
tested, and debugged @ sourceforge, and periodically inserted to PLT
Scheme.  Please, do join us!:

   http://schematics.sourceforge.net
   
(we don't have separate mailing lists @ sourceforge.  We have a couple
of forums there, though.  Of course, you can send us mail directly,
or... well, we read the PLT Scheme mailing list.)
